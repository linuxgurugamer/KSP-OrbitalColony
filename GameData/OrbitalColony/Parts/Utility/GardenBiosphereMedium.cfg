	description = Combining new advances in Direct-to-Root (TM) hydroponics technology with traditional agriculture and the ancient art of origami, Netherdyne presents the Small Garden Biosphere. A step up from our smaller hydroponics range, this computer-controlled unit allows forming a complete biosphere for several families of kerbals. By folding the garden in on itself, we've compacted it into a handy sphere, suitable for integration into any large space station.
